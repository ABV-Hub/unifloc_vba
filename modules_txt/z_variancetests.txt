'Two-sample F-test
'
'This test checks three hypotheses about dispersions of the given  samples.
'The following tests are performed:
'    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the dispersions are equal)
'    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis  -  the  dispersion  of  the first
'      sample is greater than or equal to  the  dispersion  of  the  second
'      sample).
'    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  dispersion  of  the  first
'      sample is less than or equal to the dispersion of the second sample)
'
'The test is based on the following assumptions:
'    * the given samples have normal distributions
'    * the samples are independent.
'
'Input parameters:
'    X   -   sample 1. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
'    N   -   sample size.
'    Y   -   sample 2. Array whose index goes from 0 to M-1.
'    M   -   sample size.
'
'Output parameters:
'    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
'                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
'                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
'    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
'                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
'                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
'    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
'                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
'                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
