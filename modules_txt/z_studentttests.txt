'One-sample t-test
'
'This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given sample.  The
'following tests are performed:
'    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is equal  to  the  given
'      value)
'    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  mean  is  greater  than  or
'      equal to the given value)
'    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is less than or  equal
'      to the given value).
'
'The test is based on the assumption that  a  given  sample  has  a  normal
'distribution and  an  unknown  dispersion.  If  the  distribution  sharply
'differs from normal, the test will work incorrectly.
'
'Input parameters:
'    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
'    N       -   size of sample.
'    Mean    -   assumed value of the mean.
'
'Output parameters:
'    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
'                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
'                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
'    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
'                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
'                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
'    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
'                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
'                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
